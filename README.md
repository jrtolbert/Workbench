# Workbench
A repository holding projects worked on in my free time

I use vscode to clone the repo. To start the app, first make sure your vscode has npm and node installed. You can check this by doing the following within your vscode terminal (make sure it's a bash or linux terminal):
npm --version
node --version
If those aren't recognized commands, you'd probably have to install those and that's doing a lot. Otherwise, next run npm install within the form-app folder to install necessary dependencies that for some reason don't get added when I push up my changes to the repository. 
After npm install, you can use the npm start command to boot up the app
